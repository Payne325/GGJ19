Global Game Jam Entry 2019: HOME INVASION

HOME INVASION is a homage to DOOM era 2.5D first person shooters. You play as a war veteran who is forced to protect his home from invading baddies and monsters. Home is where you feel protected... and it's going to stay that way damn it!

HOME INVASION has been fully coded from the ground up. The graphics and assets engine is written in RUST, and the core game logic is written in Python3. Communication is possible via a external C interface defined by the RUST library.
